\wde{Polynomially Reducible} A problem $P_1$ is \emph{polynomially reducible} to $P_2$, written $P_1 \lep P_2$, if there is a polynomially-bounded reduction from $P_1$ to $P_2$. 
\wde{$\NP$-Hard} A problem $P$ is $\NP$-Hard if, for every $A \in \NP$, $A \lep P$. If a problem $P_1$ is $\NP$-Hard, and $P_1 \lep P_2$, then $P_2$ is $\NP$-Hard.
\wde{$\NP$-Complete} A problem is $\NP$-complete if it is both $\NP$-hard and in $\NP$.
